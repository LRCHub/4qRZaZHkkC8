# LESLIE PARRISH – KILLING MY LOVE

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
You're gonna destroy my love
With your actions, you destroy my heart
You give me always bad surprises, so tell me, tell me why
You treat my feelings like a toy

Baby, make up, make up, make up, your mind's time to wake up
They gave us just one life to live
Baby, love and love and love me, love is what is worth it
The most important thing to give

But you're killing my love, and it will destroy me
But you're killing my love, my heart's disappointed
I'll love you forever, but please don't say never
I'll keep you remembered so deep in my heart

But you're killing my love, and it will destroy me
But you're killing my love, my heart's disappointed
A dream lasts forever if we dream together
I don't want to believe in love anymore

You're gonna destroy my life
I was thinking to become your wife
You give me million of your lies, so tell me, tell me why
You think that love is not a joy

Baby, make up, make up, make up, your mind's time to wake up
They gave us just one life to live
Baby, love and love and love me, love is what is worth it
The most important thing to give

But you're killing my love, and it will destroy me
But you're killing love, my heart's disappointed
I'll love you forever, but please don't say never
I'll keep you remembered so deep in my heart

But you're killing my love, and it will destroy me
But you're killing my love, my heart's disappointed
A dream lasts forever if we dream together
I don't want to believe in love anymore

Killing my love (kill, kill, kill)
Killing my love (kill, kill, kill)
Killing my love (kill, kill, kill)
Killing my love

But you're killing my love, and it will destroy me
But you're killing my love, my heart's disappointed
A dream lasts forever if we dream together
I don't want to believe in love anymore

Baby, make up, make up, make up, your mind's time to wake up
They gave us just one life to live
Baby, love and love and love me, love is what is worth it
The most important thing to give

But you're killing my love, and it will destroy me
But you're killing my love, my heart's disappointed
I'll love you forever, but please don't say never
I'll keep your remembered so deep in my heart

But you're killing my love, and it will destroy me
But you're killing my love, my heart's disappointed
A dream lasts forever if we dream together
I don't want to believe in love anymore

Killing my love1
