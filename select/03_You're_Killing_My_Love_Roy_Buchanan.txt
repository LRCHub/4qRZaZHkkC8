You're killing my love
Day by day
You're killing my love
In every way
And if you succeed
Oh, it will hurt you till your dying day

What done is murder
In the first degree
Don't dig your own self
Why take it out on me
You're killing my love
Oh in every way
And if you succeed
Oh, it will hurt you till your dying day

Love is a person
Who knows how to give in
The things I give you, baby
I'll never see you again
You're killing my love
Oh, in every way
And if you succeed
Oh, it's gonna hurt you till your dying day

You've got me thinking murder
But you're not worth my time
You'll get what you deserve, baby
Later on down the line
You're killing my love
Oh, in every way
And if you succeed
Oh, it will hurt you till your dying day

You're killing my love
You're killing my love
In every way
