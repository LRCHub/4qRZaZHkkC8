Summer time, with cold emotions
In my life I need devotion
I was born to love you baby save my life

Your love is risky like a viper
Your soul is crazy likie a killer
Baby you could betray my passion
Got to leave you to be safe
Tonight you're

Killing my love, you're killing my love
I feel the poison in my veins
You baby are killing me softly
Tonight wanna feel your love
Believe me baby

Killing my love, you're killing my love
I feel the poison in my veins
Tonight you're killing me softly with your feelings
Oh baby can't see?
Killing my love

Every time, I search your passion
Every night give me an illusion
Need to set my eyes on you to feel all right

Your love is risky like a viper
Your soul is crazy likie a killer
Baby you could betray my passion
Got to leave you to be safe
Tonight you're

Killing my love, you're killing my love
I feel the poison in my veins
You baby are killing me softly
Tonight wanna feel your love
Believe me baby

Killing my love, you're killing my love
I feel the poison in my veins
Tonight you're killing me softly with your feelings
Oh baby can't see?
Killing my love
